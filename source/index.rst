Welcome to PmPWorld!
====================

This website will host a series of materials and database about the Moho-reflected wave --- PmP phase.


.. figure:: /photos/PmPShow.png
   :alt: In the left panel, it shows ray paths of three typical seismic phases: Pg, at short distances, either an upgoing P wave from a source in the upper crust or a P wave bottoming in the upper crust; Pn, any P wave from a source in the crust bottoming in the uppermost mantle; PmP, P reflection from the outer side of the Moho. In the right panel, it shows the typical filed PmP waveforms in three components. Waveforms have been aligned at the first P-wave onset time. Red, orange and cyan bars denote the arrivals for PmP, S and SmS phases.
