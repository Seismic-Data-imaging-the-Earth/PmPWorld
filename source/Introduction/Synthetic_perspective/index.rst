In the figure, the synthetic vertical-component waveforms (filtered between 1-7 Hz) are shown (a), and they're computed
in the one-layer crust model (d) by using the frequency-wavenumber (FK) sythetic seismogram package
(`Zhu & Rivera, 2002 <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-246X.2002.01610.x>`_).

We observe minor differences between the apparent incident angles of the P and PmP waves (b) for each synthetic trace.
And the amplitude ratio between the PmP and P waves (c) is larger than 2.0 in most cases for each synthetic trace.
Note that the ratio values greater than 10.0 are plotted as inverted triangles.
